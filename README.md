This is a bit of a failed idea I had of using a Markov chain sentence generator on a collection of RaysWorks subtitles for shitpost potential.
Obviously not a great idea from the start since the sample of sentences collected were extremely broad, but it is still a fully functional Markov chain 
sentence generator so you can adjust the input and get new results if you want.
